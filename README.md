I adapted Studio Ghibli's site, along with MomoFuku's navigation bar, to create a website that displays cute baby animals!
Most of what I wanted to accomplish worked. The responsive webpage works pretty well, except there are some flexboxes that are just slightly off-centered. Also, some of the font sizes are a little small asd well!

URLs of mimicked pages:
1. https://www.studioghibli.com.au/
2. https://momofuku.com/

Extra Credit:
1. I used Figma to design and create the "CBA" Logo that I have in the top left corner.
